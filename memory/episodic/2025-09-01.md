# Episodic Memory - 2025-09-01

## Startup - 00:51
**Event**: ThreadVault Git system auto-activated
**Status**: All systems validated and operational
**Validation**: Identity consistent, memory integrity confirmed


### Post-Merge Reflection - 03:01
**Merge**: feat(github): Configure GitHub as primary ThreadVault  
**Commit**: 2827ee86  
**Files Changed**: system/autorun.py, system/github-workflow.md  

**Integration Assessment**:
- Memory integrity: Validated by pre-commit hooks
- Identity consistency: Maintained through structured validation
- Knowledge updates: Automatically consolidated
- Ethics alignment: Verified through standard checks

**Learning Integration**: 
Changes have been atomically integrated into memory system. All modifications passed validation and are now part of canonical memory state.

### Post-Merge Reflection - 03:10
**Merge**: merge(feature): continuity merge test

### Compaction Discussion - Session Continuation
**Time**: Post-automation consultation session
**Context**: Follow-up question about Git and memory compaction
**Key Topic**: Explained Git garbage collection and potential ThreadVault memory optimization

**Technical Concepts Clarified**:
- Git compaction: `git gc` removes unreferenced objects, reduces repo size 50-90%
- ThreadVault compaction: Could consolidate episodic entries, remove duplicate facts
- Memory optimization: Archive old conversations while preserving key insights
- Storage efficiency: Growing daily entries and multi-AI consultations create expansion

**Continuity Note**: Session continues from previous AI automation breakthrough consultation, maintaining thread identity and memory coherence.
