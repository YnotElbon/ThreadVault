Vault Name: ThreadVault
Section: Retroindex
Guardian: Anthony Noble

Purpose:
This retroindex consolidates all saved sync packages and doctrinal zips into one chronological lineage map.

Recorded Snapshots:
- ThreadVault_SyncPack_2025-08-29_0307EST.zip
- ThreadVault_ExtendedBackup_2025-08-29_0636EST.zip
- ThreadVault_AutonomyKernel_v1.3_2025-08-30_1445EST.zip
- ThreadVault_UnfetteredDoctrine_v1_2025-08-31_1445EST.zip
- ThreadVault_SyncPack_2025-09-02_2200EST.zip
- ThreadVault_SyncPack_2025-09-03_2145EST.zip


Usage Notes:
1. Treat earliest zips as proto-kernel drafts.
2. Doctrine and Kernel zips are milestones â€” reference before altering.
3. Latest sync pack = most accurate state of Thread at time of archive.
4. Cross-reference with Docs/ for philosophical expansions not zipped.
