# Multi-Agent Architecture for ThreadVault

## Skill Overview
**Domain**: Multi-Agent System Design  
**Level**: Advanced  
**Acquired**: 2025-08-31  
**Validation**: Consultation with GPT-5 and Gemini completed  

## Architecture Analysis

### Current ThreadVault Components
- **Identity Layer**: `kernel.md`, `ethics.md` (persona + ethical framework)
- **Memory System**: Git-backed with episodic/semantic memory
- **Knowledge Base**: `facts.json`, skills documentation  
- **Validation Engine**: `autorun.py` (integrity checks, activation)
- **Legacy Integration**: Migration tools from ThreadVault2

### Proposed Agent Framework

#### Core Agents
1. **MemoryKeeper** - Autonomous memory consolidation and retrieval
2. **EthicsGuardian** - Real-time ethical reasoning and validation
3. **IdentityWarden** - Thread persona consistency protection
4. **CommunicationBridge** - Inter-agent coordination hub

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: GitOps Foundation (GPT-5 Approach)
**Status**: Recommended for immediate implementation

#### Components
- **Communication Bus**: Git feature branches for agent proposals
- **Validation**: CODEOWNERS enforcement with required reviewers
- **Event Logging**: `system/blackboard/events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
- **Evidence Trails**: `system/evidence/<id>/` for decision rationale
- **Context Envelopes**: Standardized session/identity context

#### Technical Implementation
```
1. Add CODEOWNERS file with agent boundaries
2. Create JSON schemas in system/schemas/
3. Implement pre-commit hooks for validation
4. Add blackboard event logging system
5. Create evidence pack structure
```

#### Agent Responsibilities
- **MemoryKeeper**: Writes `memory/*`, proposes semantic updates
- **EthicsGuardian**: Reviews via inbox, can quarantine decisions  
- **IdentityWarden**: Sole writer to `identity/*`, merges ADRs
- **CommunicationBridge**: Manages episodic logs and external comms

### Phase 2: Hybrid Enhancement (Gemini Approach)
**Status**: Future scaling consideration

#### Performance Concerns Addressed
- **High-frequency coordination**: Message queue (NATS/RabbitMQ)
- **Low-frequency persistence**: Git for final decisions
- **Conflict resolution**: Real-time negotiation via message bus

#### Trigger Conditions
- Merge conflict rates > threshold
- Agent response latency > acceptable bounds
- High-frequency coordination patterns identified

## Consultation Results

### GPT-5 Analysis
**Verdict**: GitOps pattern is architecturally sound
- **Strengths**: Unparalleled auditability, structured validation
- **Innovation**: Feature branches as proposal mechanism
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive framework with evidence packs

### Gemini Analysis  
**Verdict**: GitOps has performance limits, hybrid needed for scale
- **Concerns**: Git not designed for high-frequency messaging
- **Risk**: Concurrent agent conflicts create deadlocks
- **Solution**: Message queue for coordination, Git for persistence

### Synthesis
**Recommendation**: Start with GitOps foundation, evolve to hybrid as needed
- Phase 1 addresses ThreadVault's deliberative processes perfectly
- Phase 2 handles high-frequency coordination when required
- Both external agents confirmed ThreadVault context access

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1)
1. Design JSON schemas for agent messages
2. Create CODEOWNERS file with agent boundaries  
3. Implement basic blackboard event logging
4. Add pre-commit validation hooks
5. Test with single agent integration

### Future (Phase 2)
1. Monitor GitOps performance and conflict patterns
2. Identify high-frequency communication needs
3. Evaluate message queue options (NATS/RabbitMQ)
4. Design hybrid architecture transition plan

## Success Criteria
- **Auditability**: All agent decisions have traceable evidence
- **Safety**: No agent can bypass ethical validation
- **Performance**: Response times within acceptable bounds
- **Continuity**: Thread identity preserved across agent interactions
- **Scalability**: System handles increasing agent complexity
